# aadhar_smart_slot
A government-grade prototype to manage crowd and appointments at Aadhaar Seva Kendras. The system auto-allocates center, date, and time using city/pincode-based logic, absorbs walk-ins with guaranteed service, provides instant SMS confirmation and receipts, and enables admin-controlled load balancing and failure handling.
